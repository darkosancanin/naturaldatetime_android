## Overview 
Android client for the Natural Date and Time application.

Natural Date and Time is a natural language date and time zone engine which allows you to view time and date information for any major city in the world. You can do time zone conversions and view the current time and daylight saving time information about cities all by querying in natural English text.

I originally wrote and released this application in 2012. I recently updated it and re-released it to the Google Play store, you can download it at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-date-and-time/kammhglamkjkibfpibckchmeolehhpgb

See https://github.com/darkosancanin/naturaldatetime_web and http://www.naturaldateandtime.com for more details on the application.
